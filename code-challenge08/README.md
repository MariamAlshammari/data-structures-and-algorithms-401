## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
1. Write a function called zip lists
2. Arguments: 2 linked lists
3. Return: Linked List, zipped.
4. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency:
