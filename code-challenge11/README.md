# stack-queue-pseudo
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a new class called pseudo queue using and implements 2 methods

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
BigO:
Time:O(n)
Space O(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
Methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h
